## Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using logistic regression, a popular machine learning technique for binary classification tasks. Employee attrition, the rate at which employees leave a company, is a critical concern for organizations. By analyzing various factors related to employees, we aim to develop a predictive model that can identify potential attrition risks and help in implementing effective retention strategies.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Dataset
[click here to get database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/code
)

The dataset used in this project is the "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains a range of features including demographic information, job-related factors, and employee satisfaction levels. The target variable, "Attrition," indicates whether an employee has left the company or not.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in the Requirements section.
3. Run the `logistic_regression_analysis.py` script to perform logistic regression analysis on the dataset.

## Files
- [dataSET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/code
)`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `logistic_regression_analysis.py`: Python script for performing logistic regression analysis.


## Assumptions OF logistic regression
The logistic regression analysis assumes the following:
- Linearity of log odds
- Independence of observations
- Absence of multicollinearity
- Large sample size
- Linearity in the logit
- No outliers
- Binary dependent variable
- No endogeneity

## Methodology
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Development
4. Model Evaluation

#  Conclusion
After running the analysis script, the following results are obtained:
- Model accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Predictions for test data

Here are some conclusions you can draw from the project:

- Model Performance: The model demonstrates decent predictive performance, with an accuracy of nearly 87%. This suggests that the selected features are informative in predicting survival.

- Further Analysis: Consider analyzing misclassified instances and exploring feature importance to gain insights into areas where the model may be lacking. Additionally, you might experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, or feature engineering techniques to potentially improve performance further.

- Domain Knowledge Integration: Incorporating domain knowledge can enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of the model. Understanding which features are most relevant in the context of survival prediction can help refine the model and make it more actionable for stakeholders.

- Model Deployment: If the model meets the desired performance criteria, consider deploying it for real-world use. However, continue monitoring its performance and updating it as necessary to ensure its effectiveness over time.

Overall, while the model shows promise, there is room for refinement and further analysis to optimize its performance and utility for the intended application
